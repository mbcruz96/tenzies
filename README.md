### Tenzies Game

This project is a dynamic and engaging web version of the classic dice game, **Tenzies**. Built with **React** and **Vite**, the application challenges players to roll dice until all ten display the same value. The core gameplay loop involves rolling a set of dice and selectively "holding" the ones they want to keep, a mechanic that highlights the game's interactive nature. The design prioritizes a clean, user-friendly interface that lets the game's core loop—rolling, holding, and winning—shine.

This project was a great opportunity to explore several key front-end development concepts. The use of **React's** state management was central to the application, as each die's individual state—whether it's held, its value, and its visual appearance—had to be managed and updated in real time. The game's logic, including checking for a win and implementing a timer to challenge players, showcases an ability to build functional and complex application logic. By using **Vite**, the project also benefits from a modern, performant build process, ensuring the final application is fast and responsive.

This Tenzies game isn't just a simple game; it's a demonstration of my ability to build polished, interactive applications from the ground up, with a strong focus on component-based architecture and efficient state management.
